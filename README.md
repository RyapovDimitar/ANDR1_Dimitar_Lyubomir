# ANDR1_Dimitar_Lyubomir

This is our android project - it is an app, providing information about the schedule and the grades of a student. 

It is using the API provided from the Fontys University - swagger.

We have decided to use the dropdown menu in order to change the views and we are requesting login and token
from the API whenever a user wants to see schedule or grades(not on opening of the application).
